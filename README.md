# **Reciprocal Commercial Contribution License (RCCL) – Version 1.6-draft**
*Copyright © 2025 [Company] and individual contributors.*  
*You may use, modify, and distribute the Work (defined below) only under the terms of this License.*


> _Hey Developers! We developed RCCL with you in mind, and this license is our way of keeping it strong, innovative, and freely available for almost everything you do. Go ahead: use it for your personal projects, academic work, and even most commercial applications. Our goal is to empower you. The only time RCCL asks for something back is to ensure fairness and fuel the R&D that benefits everyone, including you. If you build a significant commercial service by deeply modifying and hosting our code, we simply ask that those awesome enhancements are merged back. This isn't about restriction; it's about shared success. It prevents 'strip-mining' where big players might exploit the core tech without giving back, dividng the community and stopping innovation. Let's build amazing things together, sustainably._

## Friendly Overview (‑TL;DR‑)

* **Personal & Academic Use** – Free forever. Keep this license notice.
* **Business Use (non‑hosting)** – If you modify the code **either** (a) upstream those changes within **18 months** **or** (b) purchase a commercial licence. If you make **no** modifications, simply send a notice e‑mail.
* **Commercial Hosting** – You may host the unmodified Work by sending a notice e‑mail without paying any fees. If you **modify** the Work for your hosted service, you **must** upstream those modifications (licence‑fee option is **not** available).

*(This summary is non‑binding; read the full terms below.)*

This License uses the exclusive rights granted by copyright—and the patent grant below—to ensure that anyone who turns the Work into a **paid, public cloud service** must share their improvements back. Pure internal use and ordinary downstream consumption are **always free of charge** and never trigger the share-back duty.  The goal is perpetual openness without inviting “strip-mining” by proprietary hosting providers.

(a) If You make any Covered Modifications while using the Work solely for internal business operations, You must, **within eighteen (18) months** of first production use, either (i) satisfy §§ 3.2–3.3 (Share-back) **or** (ii) obtain a separate commercial licence from the Licensor.
